# Estate Manager Project Solution

# Estate Manager (V1.0.0)

This repository contains the solution for the Estate Manager Canvas App (Power Apps). See below the services and screens of the business application.
For every service, there is an automated email that will be sent to the requester and the facility team. Also, this solution sends approvals to the user's respective line manager or Head of Department. These processes are automated. 
The codes were optimized for speed, stability, reusability, and efficiency.
